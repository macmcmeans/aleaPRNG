Alea is a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) created by Johannes BaagÃ¸e, released in 2010. It implements his variation on Marsaglia's Multiply-with-carry theme, adapted to javascript's quaint notion of numbers: the carries are exactly the integer parts of Numbers with exactly 32 bits of fractional part.

## Application:
Use this to quickly generate random numbers with good statistical properties. NOTE: This generator is not cryptographically secure. If you need a secure generator then consider <a href="https://github.com/macmcmeans/isaacCSPRNG">ISAAC</a> for your application; a fast, long-period generator and discrete message cipher.

## Period:
~2<sup>116</sup>

## Example usage:

```
// return an instance of the generator initialized internally with Window.crypto
> myRandomNumbers = aleaPRNG();


// return an instance of the generator initialized with specified seed
> myRandomNumbers = aleaPRNG( 'my', '3', 'seeds' );


// return a 32-bit fraction in the range [0, 1]
> myRandomNumbers();                              -->  0.30802189325913787


// advance the generator specified number of cycles
> myRandomNumbers.prng( 4 );


// return an unsigned random integer in the range [0, 2^32]
> myRandomNumbers.int32();                        -->  704896377


// return a 53-bit fraction in the range [0, 1]
> myRandomNumbers.double();                       -->  0.9397002613178349


// return 32-bit range (inclusive) //
// from -99 to 2.1275
> myRandomNumbers.range( -99, 2.1275 );           -->  -9.723206152322817

// parameter order does not matter
> myRandomNumbers.range( 100, -99 );              -->  43

// from 0 to 12345
> myRandomNumbers.range( 12345 );                 -->  9929


// reseed generator with a new value
> myRandomNumbers.seed( 'this is a new seed' );


> myRandomNumbers();                              -->  0.20963897299952805


// restart generator (reverts back to first specified seed)
> myRandomNumbers.restart();


// our first 32-bit fraction
> myRandomNumbers();                              -->  0.30802189325913787
